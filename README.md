# neuralninechatbot
Chat bot created using Neural Nine's tutorial. I do not own this source code and full credit goes to NeuralNine.

Save the intents.json, the training.py, and the chatbot.py in the same folder. 

You can edit the intents.json if you would like.

Steps after you download the files:
1. Open the training.py file, and wait for the chatbot to learn the words sentences.
2. Open the chatbot.py file, and you should be able to chat!

If you run into an error with any of the modules, make sure to pip install [module].
For nltk, you may need to visit https://www.nltk.org/data.html to install the requirements for nltk
